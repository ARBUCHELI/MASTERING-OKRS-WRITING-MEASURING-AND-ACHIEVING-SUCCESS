-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Understanding OKRs
--------------------
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a powerful  goal-setting framework that helps organizations align their vision with execution.

This framework originated at Intel and has been a game-changer for companies like Google.

OKRs are not just about setting goals; they're about aligning your team's efforts with the strategic direction of your company.

They provide a clear path to follow, with measurable steps that ensure everyone is moving in the same direction.

OKRs have two main components: Objectives and key results.

	. Objectives are your ambitious goals. They are qualitative and should make you stretch beyond your comfort zone. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** AT THE MOMENT TO CREATE A DEMO THAT CAN
	BE ACCEPTED BY GAZPROM.

	. Key results, on the other hand, are the quantifiable outcomes that let you know you're achieving your objectives. They often focus on growth, engagement, revenue, performance, or 
 	quality. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** THE DEMO NEEDS TO SHOW THE CALCULATIONS.

Now, let's talk about the best practices for setting OKRs.

	. It's recommended to set OKRs both yearly and quarterly to maintain a strategic focus while allowing for adaptability. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** IN THREE MONTHS WE NEED TO CREATE
	A DEMO THAT CAN BE ACCEPTED BY THE COMPANY THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE.

	. Always include numeric targets in your key results to make your progress measurable and transparent. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (DESIGN THIS STRATEGY)

	. However, be cautious not to overwhelm yourself or your team with too many OKRs.

The key is to prioritize and focus on what truly matters.

Evaluating your OKRs is a critical step in the process.

	. Key results are assessed using a 0-1 scale, with the average score reflecting the success of the objective. 
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (ASK THE TEAM IF THE RESULTS WERE ACHIEVED) ****

	. Grading takes place at the start of the next quarter, providing a clear start and end point for your goals. 
	*** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (ON AUGUST 16TH WE NEED TO KNOW IF WE ACHIEVED THE RESULT OF HAVING A DEMO THAT CAN SATISFY GAZPROM).

As with any framework, there are common mistakes to avoid with OKRs.

	. Setting too many OKRs can dilute focus and effectiveness.

	. Objectives shouldn't just be metric-driven, rather should be inspirational and aligned with your mission.
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE A VERY GOOD DEMO).

	. It's also crucial to differentiate between tasks and key results –key results measure success, not just activity. 
 
	. Implementing well-crafted OKRs enables organizations to track progress and adapt their strategies quickly, ensuring agility in a fast-paced business environment.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Importance of OKRs
--------------------
OKRs are not just a tool for setting goals; they are a bridge that connects the aspirations of individuals with the broader mission of the organization.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****

. Elena is becoming a good frotend developer.
. Anastassia is becoming a good UI/UX designer.
. I'm becoming a better project manager.
. Dmitry is becoming a better Business Analyst.

By aligning personal objectives with the company's strategic direction, we create a unified force moving towards common goals.

This alignment is crucial as it ensures that every team member's efforts contribute to the bigger picture, fostering a sense of unity and purpose.

One of the most significant benefits of OKRs is their ability to enhance engagement and motivation.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** This is something that we need to improve.

When individuals clearly understand their goals and can measure their progress, they take ownership of their work. This sense of responsibility, coupled with the transparency and 
accountability inherent in the OKR framework, boosts motivation and drives performance.

	. By setting clear, measurable targets, OKRs help individuals see the impact of their contributions, fostering a culture of continuous personal and professional growth.

	. OKRs are a powerful tool for driving performance and success within an organization.

	. By setting a clear benchmark for what success looks like, OKRs encourage individuals and teams to stretch their capabilities and aim for continuous improvement.

	. At the heart of the OKR framework is the promotion of open communication and collaboration. By openly sharing goals and progress, we break down silos and encourage  
	cross-functional teamwork. This transparency builds trust and ensures that everyone is working towards shared objectives.

	. OKRs can enhance problem-solving by bringing together diverse perspectives and collective input.

	. This culture of collaboration can lead to innovative solutions and a stronger, more cohesive organization.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Crafting Effective OKRs
-------------------------
The first step towards crafting effective OKRs is writing impactful objectives.

Objectives should be ambitious and inspirational, serving as a north star that guides your efforts.

They need to resonate with your team, aligning with the company's mission and vision to provide clear direction.

It's essential to keep the number of objectives limited to a manageable number to maintain focus and ensure that each one can be given the attention it deserves.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
At the moment we have the following information for creating objectives:

. According to Vitaliy 95% of the demo is ready, and it will be fully completed on 10/07/2024

. According to Valeriy Mikhailovich only 60% of the demo is ready:

	. It is necessary to show the real values of the numbers for at least two different GPAs and in two different solutions: with and without discounting.

	. The graphic content should correspond to the numerical content.

Once you have your objectives set, the next step is to define clear key results. These are the quantifiable outcomes that will indicate whether you're on track to achieve your objectives.

Key results should focus on specific outcomes like growth, engagement, or revenue, and must include numeric targets to track progress effectively.

It's recommended to limit key results to 4 per objectiveto maintain clarity and focus. It's important to remember that key results should not  only be measurable but also meaningful, 
ensuring that they truly reflect the success of your objectives.

Even with the best intentions, it's easy to fall into common pitfalls when setting OKRs.

. One key mistake is confusing key results with mere tasks. Key results should measure the impact of your efforts, not just the completion of activities.

. It's also important to avoid setting too many or too few OKRs, as well as ensuring that they are challenging but achievable.

. Another critical point is to refrain from tying OKRs directly to performance reviews, which can lead to conservative goal-setting.

. Well-written OKRs should show clarity and focus.

. Poorly written OKRs are generally vague and non-measurable.

. For example, a poorly written objective for a software developer in a product-based company can be "Make the product better.

. "A well-written objective in this case may be"Enhance product performance and user satisfaction.

. "Similarly, "Work on making the app faster, and get good feedback onwhatever new stuff we add" constitute poorly written key results.

. The first key result can be written in a better way, such as"Reduce the load time of the main application dashboard by 30% by Q2, as measured by internal performance testing tools.

. "Similarly, the second key result can be written as"Achieve a 90% positive feedback rate on the new feature released in Q3 from user surveys and in-app feedback tools.

. "From the example, it is obvious that:

	. first, well-written OKRs are specific and measurable. They clearly define what is to be achieved and how success will be measured, for example, "Reduce the load time of the main 
	application dashboard by 30%."

	. Second, well-written OKRs are achievable – the goals are ambitious, yet realistic, providing a clear target for the developer to aim for.

	. Third, well-written OKRs are relevant, as each key result directly contributes to the objective of enhancing product performance and user satisfaction, aligning with the 
	company's goals.

	. Lastly, well-written objectives are time-bound and have set deadlines creating a sense of urgency and a timeline for achievement.

Let's try to understand the common errors in setting OKRs.Consider a scenario where a software company plans to launch a new feature aimed at improving user engagement with their 
application.

The development team is tasked with designing, implementing, and deploying this feature within a three-month timeframe.

. The first possible error in this case can be a vague objective, such as "Make the app more engaging. "This objective is too broad and doesn't specify what "engaging" means in measurable 
terms. A possible solution is to refine the objective to be specific and measurable, for example, "Increase daily active users by 20% by the end of Q3 through the launch of the new 
engagement feature.

. "The second possible error can be non-measurable key result, for example, "Get positive feedback on the new feature. "The issue with this key result is that itdoesn't specify how 
feedback will be measured or what constitutes "positive. "A possible solution is to make the key result measurable with clear criterion, for example, "Achieve an average user satisfaction 
score of 4.5/5for the new feature based on the post-launch survey responses.

. "The third possible error can be setting unrealistic key result, for example, "Have zero bugs at launch. "While aiming for high quality, expecting zero bugs is unrealistic and sets the 
team up for failure.

. A possible solution in this case is to set achievable and realistic key result, for example, "Reduce critical bug reports to fewer than 3 within the first month of launch."The fourth 
possible error can be the key result not aligning with objective, for example, "Increase the number of social media mentions of the app by 50%. "The issue in this case is that while 
social media mentions might increase brand visibility, they don't directly measure the success of the new feature in making the app more engaging.

. The possible solution is to ensure that the key result directly supports the objective.

. A better key result in this case might be, "Increase user session time by 15% as a result of engaging with the new feature."These errors can simply be avoided by being specific and 
measurable, setting realistic expectations, aligning key results with objectives, and regularly reviewing and adjusting the OKRs as needed.

. Avoiding these common errors and following the suggested solutions can help teams set effective OKRs that are clear, achievable, and directly aligned with their strategic goals.

* Manager's Role in OKR Success
-------------------------------
As we move forward, let's focus on the role of a manager in OKR success. A key aspect of this role is guiding teams in setting their OKRs.

**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(Information provided by Dmitry)

1) to get 4 СЖЦ calculations done (I’m doing it now, will be ready by the morning) 
2) link these calculations to the graphs (it’s on Vitaliy) 
3) link the calculation setup tree to the lifecycle for the preservation section (it’s on Vitaliy too).

. Managers play a crucial part in helping teams understand the OKR framework and 

. ensuring that the objectives set are aligned with the organization's goals.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(Dmitry claims to be in charge of this part, because he is communicating with the directors of the company) ---> In a Scrum framework Dmitry is acting as a Product Owner.

. It's about striking a balance between ambition and realism, encouraging teams to set goals that stretch their capabilities while remaining achievable
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(Dmitry claims to be in charge of this part, because he is discussing the deadlines with the directors of the company)

. As a manager, you can facilitate brainstorming sessions for OKR development and support your team in setting OKRs that are both inspiring and aligned with the company's strategic 
direction.
*** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(We should discuss this together)

Once OKRs are set, the next step is implementing them effectively.

. As a manager, you'll need to integrate OKRs into the regular workflows of your team,
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WE CAN MIX OKR WITH AGILE FOR DEFINING USER STORIES FOR EXAMPLE)

. monitor progress, and provide ongoing support.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (HERE IS IMPORTANT TO DON'T CREATE SILOS, BECAUSE WITHOUT A CULTURE OF TRANSPARENCY IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MONITOR PROGRESS).

It's important to address challenges as they arise and adjust OKRs when necessary. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** VERY IMPORTANT

. Celebrating milestones is also crucial for maintaining motivation and recognizing the hard work of your team.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (THIS SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION).

An important strategy for effective OKR implementation is to keep your team focused and motivated throughout the OKR cycle.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAM LOSE MOTIVATION BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THEIR CONTRIBUTION IS NOT VALUABLE).

* Coaching is also an integral part of achieving OKRs.
------------------------------------------------------
. Providing regular feedback on OKR progress is essential, as is 
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (FOR THIS REASON THE DAILY STANDUPS THAT WERE ADOPTED FROM SCRUM ARE VERY IMPORTANT).

. offering coaching to improve performance.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WE ARE IN THE PROCESS).

. Encouraging problem-solving and innovation within your team will help them overcome obstacles and meet their OKRs.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WE NEED TO TRAIN THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAM IN AGILE AND OKR)

. It's also important to foster a culture of learning and adaptation, where setbacks are seen as opportunities for growth.



* Finally, cultivating a supportive OKR culture is vital for the success of the framework within your organization.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. This involves promoting transparency and open communication,
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (THIS IS THE MAIN CULTURAL CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE THE IDEAL SITUATION IS THAT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAM CAN BE INFORMED OF THE
CURRENT SITUATION OF THE PROJECT, IN ORDER TO BOOST THE CREATIVE POTENTIAL OF EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM.  WITHOUT OPEN COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPARENCY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO APPLY ANY METHODOLO
GY).

. encouraging collaboration across teams,
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS THROUGHT THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COMMUNNICATION WITH VALERIY MIKHAILOVICH).

. and recognizing OKR-related achievements.

. As a leader, you must lead by example in embracing the OKR methodology. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WE NEED THE SUPPORT OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE TEAM TO APPLY THE METHODOLOGIES IN THE BEST
POSSIBLE WAY).

As a manager, you should aim to build a culture that supports OKRs, where every team member feels valued and motivated to contribute to the organization's objectives.
							                  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**** GAZPROM **** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT MOTIVATION, FEEDBACK, AND SUPPORT, EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM WILL ALWAYS BE IN A CONSTANT SEARCH FOR RUNNING AWAY FROM OUR ORGANIZA -
TION.  

REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE DON'T QUIT COMPANIES, PEOPLE ABANDON CORPORATE CULTURES THAT DON'T FIT THEIR EXPECTATIONS.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Measuring and Tracking OKRs
-----------------------------
In our journey through OKRs, we've arrived at a crucial aspect: 

. Measuring and tracking OKRs.

. Setting benchmarks for key results is where the action begins. Benchmarks are the clear, quantifiable markers of success that you'll use to measure progress. They should be ambitious 
yet realistic, pushing the team to excel while remaining within reach.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, THE MAIN BENCHMARK IS THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE DEMO BY GAZPROM).

. You should set these benchmarks using metrics such as growth, engagement, and revenue.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, THE MAIN BENCHMARK IS THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE DEMO BY GAZPROM).

Let's try to understand this by the help of a few examples:

1) For the "Growth" OKRs, the objective can be "Significantly increase market share,
"one of the key results can be "Grow the customer base by 25% by the end of Q4 through targeted marketing campaigns and referral programs,
"and the metric to track in this case can be the customer acquisition rate.
						 --------------------------
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(IN OUR CASE, THE METRIC TRACK WILL BE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE DEMO BY GAZPROM OF COURSE).


2) Similarly, for the "Engagement" OKRs, the objective can be "Boost user engagement and satisfaction,
"one of the key results can be "Increase the average session duration on the app by 15% by optimizing UI/UX design by the end of Q2,
"and the metric to track can be the average session duration.

3) Finally, for the Revenue OKRs, the objective can be"Accelerate revenue growth,
" a key result can be "Increase quarterly revenue by 20% by launching two new premium features by the end of Q2,
"and the metric to track can be "Quarterly revenue growth rate.

* Here are some tips that can help you to effectively measure and track OKRs:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) First, use the right tools. Technology plays a pivotal role in tracking OKR progress. Leverage OKR software tools that allow you to set, track, and visualize progress towards your key 
results in real-time.

The right tools can provide valuable data analysis, helping you make informed decisions and keep your team on track. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (Try to improve the use of trello).

2) Second, schedule regular check-ins. Consistency is key when it comes to OKRs, and that's where regular check-ins come into play.

These scheduled reviews are a time to discuss progress, address challenges, and share learnings. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (Similar to the sprint review).

They're also an opportunity to adjust OKRs based on performance data, ensuring that your goals remain relevant and achievable.

Schedule weekly or bi-weekly check-ins to review progress, identify blockers, and make adjustments as necessary.

3) Third, quantify your OKRs. Adjusting and adapting OKRs based on performance data is an essential part of the OKR cycle. Using a 0-1 scale for evaluating key results allows you to aim for
scores that reflect challenging goals.

Aiming for a score of 0.7 or 0.8 is ideal, as consistently scoring a 1 may indicate that your goals aren't challenging enough. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (We need to be realistic in this
point).


Remember, these grades are for learning and growth, not for evaluating employee performance.
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use them to refine your approach and set better OKRs in the future.

4) Fourth, align and communicate. Make sure OKRs are aligned across different levels of the organization and that progress is transparently communicated to all stakeholders.

Finally, learn and adapt.

Use the insights gained from tracking OKRs to learn what works and what doesn't.

Be prepared to adapt your strategies based on these learnings.

Following these tips will help you to continually drive your organization towards its strategic objectives.
