* Understanding OKRs
--------------------
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a powerful  goal-setting framework that helps organizations align their vision with execution.

This framework originated at Intel and has been a game-changer for companies like Google.

OKRs are not just about setting goals; they're about aligning your team's efforts with the strategic direction of your company.

They provide a clear path to follow, with measurable steps that ensure everyone is moving in the same direction.

OKRs have two main components: Objectives and key results.

	. Objectives are your ambitious goals. They are qualitative and should make you stretch beyond your comfort zone. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** AT THE MOMENT TO CREATE A DEMO THAT CAN
	BE ACCEPTED BY GAZPROM.

	. Key results, on the other hand, are the quantifiable outcomes that let you know you're achieving your objectives. They often focus on growth, engagement, revenue, performance, or 
 	quality. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** THE DEMO NEEDS TO SHOW THE CALCULATIONS.

Now, let's talk about the best practices for setting OKRs.

	. It's recommended to set OKRs both yearly and quarterly to maintain a strategic focus while allowing for adaptability. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** IN THREE MONTHS WE NEED TO CREATE
	A DEMO THAT CAN BE ACCEPTED BY THE COMPANY THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE.

	. Always include numeric targets in your key results to make your progress measurable and transparent. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (DESIGN THIS STRATEGY)

	. However, be cautious not to overwhelm yourself or your team with too many OKRs.

The key is to prioritize and focus on what truly matters.

Evaluating your OKRs is a critical step in the process.

	. Key results are assessed using a 0-1 scale, with the average score reflecting the success of the objective. 
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (ASK THE TEAM IF THE RESULTS WERE ACHIEVED) ****

	. Grading takes place at the start of the next quarter, providing a clear start and end point for your goals. 
	*** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (ON AUGUST 16TH WE NEED TO KNOW IF WE ACHIEVED THE RESULT OF HAVING A DEMO THAT CAN SATISFY GAZPROM).

As with any framework, there are common mistakes to avoid with OKRs.

	. Setting too many OKRs can dilute focus and effectiveness.

	. Objectives shouldn't just be metric-driven, rather should be inspirational and aligned with your mission.
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE A VERY GOOD DEMO).

	. It's also crucial to differentiate between tasks and key results –key results measure success, not just activity. 
 
	. Implementing well-crafted OKRs enables organizations to track progress and adapt their strategies quickly, ensuring agility in a fast-paced business environment.

* Importance of OKRs
--------------------
OKRs are not just a tool for setting goals; they are a bridge that connects the aspirations of individuals with the broader mission of the organization.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****

. Elena is becoming a good frotend developer.
. Anastassia is becoming a good UI/UX designer.
. I'm becoming a better project manager.
. Dmitry is becoming a better Business Analyst.

By aligning personal objectives with the company's strategic direction, we create a unified force moving towards common goals.

This alignment is crucial as it ensures that every team member's efforts contribute to the bigger picture, fostering a sense of unity and purpose.

One of the most significant benefits of OKRs is their ability to enhance engagement and motivation.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** This is something that we need to improve.

When individuals clearly understand their goals and can measure their progress, they take ownership of their work. This sense of responsibility, coupled with the transparency and 
accountability inherent in the OKR framework, boosts motivation and drives performance.

	. By setting clear, measurable targets, OKRs help individuals see the impact of their contributions, fostering a culture of continuous personal and professional growth.

	. OKRs are a powerful tool for driving performance and success within an organization.

	. By setting a clear benchmark for what success looks like, OKRs encourage individuals and teams to stretch their capabilities and aim for continuous improvement.

	. At the heart of the OKR framework is the promotion of open communication and collaboration. By openly sharing goals and progress, we break down silos and encourage  
	cross-functional teamwork. This transparency builds trust and ensures that everyone is working towards shared objectives.

	. OKRs can enhance problem-solving by bringing together diverse perspectives and collective input.

	. This culture of collaboration can lead to innovative solutions and a stronger, more cohesive organization.

* Crafting Effective OKRs
-------------------------
The first step towards crafting effective OKRs is writing impactful objectives.

Objectives should be ambitious and inspirational, serving as a north star that guides your efforts.

They need to resonate with your team, aligning with the company's mission and vision to provide clear direction.

It's essential to keep the number of objectives limited to a manageable number to maintain focus and ensure that each one can be given the attention it deserves.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
At the moment we have the following information for creating objectives:

. According to Vitaliy 95% of the demo is ready, and it will be fully completed on 10/07/2024

. According to Valeriy Mikhailovich only 60% of the demo is ready:

	. It is necessary to show the real values of the numbers for at least two different GPAs and in two different solutions: with and without discounting.

	. The graphic content should correspond to the numerical content.

Once you have your objectives set, the next step is to define clear key results. These are the quantifiable outcomes that will indicate whether you're on track to achieve your objectives.

Key results should focus on specific outcomes like growth, engagement, or revenue, and must include numeric targets to track progress effectively.

It's recommended to limit key results to 4 per objectiveto maintain clarity and focus. It's important to remember that key results should not  only be measurable but also meaningful, 
ensuring that they truly reflect the success of your objectives.

Even with the best intentions, it's easy to fall into common pitfalls when setting OKRs.

. One key mistake is confusing key results with mere tasks. Key results should measure the impact of your efforts, not just the completion of activities.

. It's also important to avoid setting too many or too few OKRs, as well as ensuring that they are challenging but achievable.

. Another critical point is to refrain from tying OKRs directly to performance reviews, which can lead to conservative goal-setting.

. Well-written OKRs should show clarity and focus.

. Poorly written OKRs are generally vague and non-measurable.

. For example, a poorly written objective for a software developer in a product-based company can be "Make the product better.

. "A well-written objective in this case may be"Enhance product performance and user satisfaction.

. "Similarly, "Work on making the app faster, and get good feedback onwhatever new stuff we add" constitute poorly written key results.

. The first key result can be written in a better way, such as"Reduce the load time of the main application dashboard by 30% by Q2, as measured by internal performance testing tools.

. "Similarly, the second key result can be written as"Achieve a 90% positive feedback rate on the new feature released in Q3 from user surveys and in-app feedback tools.

. "From the example, it is obvious that:

	. first, well-written OKRs are specific and measurable. They clearly define what is to be achieved and how success will be measured, for example, "Reduce the load time of the main 
	application dashboard by 30%."

	. Second, well-written OKRs are achievable – the goals are ambitious, yet realistic, providing a clear target for the developer to aim for.

	. Third, well-written OKRs are relevant, as each key result directly contributes to the objective of enhancing product performance and user satisfaction, aligning with the 
	company's goals.

	. Lastly, well-written objectives are time-bound and have set deadlines creating a sense of urgency and a timeline for achievement.

Let's try to understand the common errors in setting OKRs.Consider a scenario where a software company plans to launch a new feature aimed at improving user engagement with their 
application.

The development team is tasked with designing, implementing, and deploying this feature within a three-month timeframe.

. The first possible error in this case can be a vague objective, such as "Make the app more engaging. "This objective is too broad and doesn't specify what "engaging" means in measurable 
terms. A possible solution is to refine the objective to be specific and measurable, for example, "Increase daily active users by 20% by the end of Q3 through the launch of the new 
engagement feature.

. "The second possible error can be non-measurable key result, for example, "Get positive feedback on the new feature. "The issue with this key result is that itdoesn't specify how 
feedback will be measured or what constitutes "positive. "A possible solution is to make the key result measurable with clear criterion, for example, "Achieve an average user satisfaction 
score of 4.5/5for the new feature based on the post-launch survey responses.

. "The third possible error can be setting unrealistic key result, for example, "Have zero bugs at launch. "While aiming for high quality, expecting zero bugs is unrealistic and sets the 
team up for failure.

. A possible solution in this case is to set achievable and realistic key result, for example, "Reduce critical bug reports to fewer than 3 within the first month of launch."The fourth 
possible error can be the key result not aligning with objective, for example, "Increase the number of social media mentions of the app by 50%. "The issue in this case is that while 
social media mentions might increase brand visibility, they don't directly measure the success of the new feature in making the app more engaging.

. The possible solution is to ensure that the key result directly supports the objective.

. A better key result in this case might be, "Increase user session time by 15% as a result of engaging with the new feature."These errors can simply be avoided by being specific and 
measurable, setting realistic expectations, aligning key results with objectives, and regularly reviewing and adjusting the OKRs as needed.

. Avoiding these common errors and following the suggested solutions can help teams set effective OKRs that are clear, achievable, and directly aligned with their strategic goals.
