* Understanding OKRs
--------------------
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a powerful  goal-setting framework that helps organizations align their vision with execution.

This framework originated at Intel and has been a game-changer for companies like Google.

OKRs are not just about setting goals; they're about aligning your team's efforts with the strategic direction of your company.

They provide a clear path to follow, with measurable steps that ensure everyone is moving in the same direction.

OKRs have two main components: Objectives and key results.

	. Objectives are your ambitious goals. They are qualitative and should make you stretch beyond your comfort zone. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** AT THE MOMENT TO CREATE A DEMO THAT CAN
	BE ACCEPTED BY GAZPROM.

	. Key results, on the other hand, are the quantifiable outcomes that let you know you're achieving your objectives. They often focus on growth, engagement, revenue, performance, or 
 	quality. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** THE DEMO NEEDS TO SHOW THE CALCULATIONS.

Now, let's talk about the best practices for setting OKRs.

	. It's recommended to set OKRs both yearly and quarterly to maintain a strategic focus while allowing for adaptability. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** IN THREE MONTHS WE NEED TO CREATE
	A DEMO THAT CAN BE ACCEPTED BY THE COMPANY THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE.

	. Always include numeric targets in your key results to make your progress measurable and transparent. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (DESIGN THIS STRATEGY)

	. However, be cautious not to overwhelm yourself or your team with too many OKRs.

The key is to prioritize and focus on what truly matters.

Evaluating your OKRs is a critical step in the process.

	. Key results are assessed using a 0-1 scale, with the average score reflecting the success of the objective. 
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (ASK THE TEAM IF THE RESULTS WERE ACHIEVED) ****

	. Grading takes place at the start of the next quarter, providing a clear start and end point for your goals. 
	*** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (ON AUGUST 16TH WE NEED TO KNOW IF WE ACHIEVED THE RESULT OF HAVING A DEMO THAT CAN SATISFY GAZPROM).

As with any framework, there are common mistakes to avoid with OKRs.

	. Setting too many OKRs can dilute focus and effectiveness.

	. Objectives shouldn't just be metric-driven, rather should be inspirational and aligned with your mission.
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE A VERY GOOD DEMO).

	. It's also crucial to differentiate between tasks and key results –key results measure success, not just activity. 
 
	. Implementing well-crafted OKRs enables organizations to track progress and adapt their strategies quickly, ensuring agility in a fast-paced business environment.

* Importance of OKRs
--------------------
OKRs are not just a tool for setting goals; they are a bridge that connects the aspirations of individuals with the broader mission of the organization.

. Anastassia is becoming a good UI/UX designer.
. I'm becoming a better project manager.
. Dmitry is becoming a better Business Analyst.

By aligning personal objectives with the company's strategic direction, we create a unified force moving towards common goals.

This alignment is crucial as it ensures that every team member's efforts contribute to the bigger picture, fostering a sense of unity and purpose.

One of the most significant benefits of OKRs is their ability to enhance engagement and motivation.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** This is something that we need to improve.

When individuals clearly understand their goals and can measure their progress, they take ownership of their work. This sense of responsibility, coupled with the transparency and 
accountability inherent in the OKR framework, boosts motivation and drives performance.

	. By setting clear, measurable targets, OKRs help individuals see the impact of their contributions, fostering a culture of continuous personal and professional growth.

	. OKRs are a powerful tool for driving performance and success within an organization.

	. By setting a clear benchmark for what success looks like, OKRs encourage individuals and teams to stretch their capabilities and aim for continuous improvement.

	. At the heart of the OKR framework is the promotion of open communication and collaboration. By openly sharing goals and progress, we break down silos and encourage  
	cross-functional teamwork. This transparency builds trust and ensures that everyone is working towards shared objectives.

	. OKRs can enhance problem-solving by bringing together diverse perspectives and collective input.

	. This culture of collaboration can lead to innovative solutions and a stronger, more cohesive organization.
